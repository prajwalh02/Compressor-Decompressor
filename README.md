## Compressor-Decompressor Project

This is the minor project on compressor and decompressor using Java language

Objective of the project is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique
The project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression

Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs

Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing
